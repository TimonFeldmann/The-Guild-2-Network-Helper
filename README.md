This was my very first programming project, it has not been updated in 7 years. I have not looked at the code since I last touched it, I expect the code quality to be bad.

I will not be able to maintain this project so please feel free to fork it / rewrite it. My programming skills have improved dramatically in the past 7 years. I would likely rewrite this project if I were to work on it and I recommend the same for anyone who wishes to improve this project.

Edit: I checked the code, it's REALLY bad. I highly recommend anyone who wants to work on this to rewrite it. This project is quite literally my first ever attempt at real programming. For any potential jobs looking at this repo, please don't, the code is atrociously bad, I'm surprised it works at all. That being said, this is a nice documentation for me of where it all began and how much has changed for me the past 7 years. :)
